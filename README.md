"Whatâ€™s in a name? That which we call a rose, By any other name would smell as sweet."

The beauty of data analysis is that surprisingly simple datasets can help us uncover so many interesting stories. That is exactly what this project is about. The dataset used for analysis is of first names of babies born in the US, that spans a period of more than 100 years! The stories of most polular names, trendy names, stable names and more have been uncovered in using this nice dataset.
